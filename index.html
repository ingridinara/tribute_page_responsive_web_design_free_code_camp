        <h3>History</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>1998 </strong>- Alistair Cockburn visited the Chrysler C3
            project in Detroit and coined the phrase "A user story is a promise
            for a conversation."
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1999 </strong>- Kent Beck published the first edition of the
            book Extreme Programming Explained, introducing Extreme Programming
            (XP),[4] and the usage of user stories in the planning game.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2001 </strong>- Ron Jeffries proposed a "Three Cs" formula
            for user story creation
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The Card (or often a post-it note) is a tangible physical token to
              hold the concepts;
            </li>
            <li>
              The Conversation is between the stakeholders (customers, users,
              developers, testers, etc.). It is verbal and often supplemented by
              documentation;
            </li>
            <li>
              The Confirmation ensures that the objectives of the conversation
              have been reached.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>
            <strong>2001 </strong>- The XP team at Connextra[6] in London
            devised the user story format and shared examples with others.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2004 </strong>- Mike Cohn generalized the principles of user
            stories beyond the usage of cards in his book User Stories Applied:
            For Agile Software Development[7] that is now considered the
            standard reference for the topic according to Martin Fowler.[8] Cohn
            names Rachel Davies as the inventor of user stories.[citation
            needed] While Davies was a team member at Connextra she credits the
            team as a whole with the invention.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2014 </strong>- After a first article in 2005[9] and a blog
            post in 2008,[10] in 2014 Jeff Patton published the user-story
            mapping technique, which intends to improve with a systematic
            approach the identification of user stories and to structure the
            stories to give better visibility to their interdependence.
